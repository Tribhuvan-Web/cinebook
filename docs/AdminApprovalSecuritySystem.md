# Admin Approval Security System - MovieDekho

## üîí Enhanced Security Overview

The MovieDekho application now includes a robust admin approval system that ensures only authorized administrators can access admin functionalities. This system prevents unauthorized admin registration and provides comprehensive approval workflow management.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Enhancements:

1. **Admin Registration Approval System**
   - New admin registrations go to "PENDING_ADMIN" status
   - Super admin email notification for every admin registration attempt
   - Manual approval/rejection process with email notifications

2. **Super Admin Panel**
   - Dedicated super admin dashboard and management endpoints
   - View pending, approved, and rejected admin requests
   - Approve or reject admin applications with optional reason

3. **Enhanced Security Configuration**
   - Pending admins cannot access any admin functionalities
   - Rejected admins are permanently blocked
   - Only approved admins can access admin endpoints

4. **Email Notification System**
   - Instant notification to super admin on admin registration attempts
   - Approval/rejection notifications to applicants
   - Professional email templates with security alerts

## üìß Email Configuration

The system uses your existing Brevo email service configuration:
- **Super Admin Email**: `moni618919@gmail.com` (configured in application.properties)
- **Sender Email**: `moni618919@gmail.com`
- **Sender Name**: Movie Dekho

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Workflow

### 1. Admin Registration Process

```bash
# When someone attempts to register as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "potential_admin",
    "password": "securepass123",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "gender": "Male"
  }'
```

**What happens:**
1. User account created with `PENDING_ADMIN` status
2. `isApproved` set to `false`
3. `requestedAt` timestamp recorded
4. **Email sent to you (super admin)** with registration details
5. Applicant receives response: "Admin registration request submitted. Please wait for approval from the super admin."

### 2. Super Admin Notification Email

You'll receive an email like this:

```
Subject: New Admin Registration Request - MovieDekho

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPER_ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN"
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPER_ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN"
```

  -d '{
    "userId": 123,
    "action": "APPROVE"
  }'
```

```

## üîê Authentication Requirements

### Super Admin Access
- Must be authenticated (have valid JWT token)
- Token must be for the super admin email: `moni618919@gmail.com`
- Email verification is done in the controller layer

### Regular Admin Access
- Must have `ROLE_ADMIN` role
- Must have `isApproved = true`
- Pending or rejected admins are automatically blocked

### User Access
- Regular users (`ROLE_USER`) are unaffected
- Continue to work normally with immediate registration

## üìä User Status Types

1. **ROLE_USER** - Regular users (immediate approval)
2. **PENDING_ADMIN** - Admin registration pending approval
3. **ROLE_ADMIN** - Approved admin (full access)
4. **REJECTED_ADMIN** - Rejected admin application

## üö´ Security Blocks

### What Pending Admins Cannot Do:
- Access any `/api/admin/**` endpoints
- Access any admin functionalities
- Login successfully (authentication will fail)
- Escalate privileges

### What Rejected Admins Cannot Do:
- Everything that pending admins cannot do
- Re-apply for admin status (without manual intervention)

## üéØ API Endpoints Summary

### Super Admin Endpoints (`/api/super-admin/`)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |

| GET | `/all-admin-requests` | Get all admin requests (pending, approved, rejected) |
| GET | `/dashboard` | Get super admin dashboard with statistics |
| POST | `/approve-admin` | Approve or reject admin registration |

### Modified Endpoints
| Endpoint | Change |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/auth/register-admin` | Now creates pending admin + sends notification |

- `isApproved` (Boolean) - Approval status
- `approvedBy` (String) - Who approved the admin
- `requestedAt` (LocalDateTime) - When admin registration was requested
- `approvedAt` (LocalDateTime) - When admin was approved

## üöÄ Getting Started

Your email `moni618919@gmail.com` is configured as the super admin. Simply:
1. Register as a regular user with your email
2. Manually change your role to `ROLE_ADMIN` in the database (one-time setup)
3. Set `isApproved = true` for your account

### 2. Testing the System
