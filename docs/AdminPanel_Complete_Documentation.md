# Admin Panel Documentation - Cinebook

## üöÄ Overview

The CineBook application features a comprehensive admin management system with enhanced security, approval workflows, and automated processes. This documentation consolidates all admin-related functionalities and provides a complete guide for managing the admin panel.

## üîí Security Overview

### Enhanced Security Features

The Cinebook application includes a robust admin approval system that ensures only authorized administrators can access admin functionalities. This prevents unauthorized admin registration and provides comprehensive approval workflow management.

**Key Security Enhancements:**

1. **Admin Registration Approval System**
   - New admin registrations go to "PENDING_ADMIN" status
   - Super admin email notification for every admin registration attempt
   - Manual approval/rejection process with email notifications

2. **Super Admin Panel**
   - Dedicated super admin dashboard and management endpoints
   - View pending, approved, and rejected admin requests
   - Approve or reject admin applications with optional reason

3. **Enhanced Security Configuration**
   - Pending admins cannot access any admin functionalities
   - Rejected admins are permanently blocked
   - Only approved admins can access admin endpoints

4. **Email Notification System**
   - Instant notification to super admin on admin registration attempts
   - Approval/rejection notifications to applicants
   - Professional email templates with security alerts

## üìß Email Configuration

The system uses Brevo email service configuration:
- **Super Admin Email**: `tri******7@gmail.com` (configured in application.properties)
- **Sender Email**: `tri******7@gmail.com`
- **Sender Name**: CineBook

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin Registration & Approval Workflow

### 1. Admin Registration Process

When someone attempts to register as admin:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "potential_admin",
    "password": "securepass123",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "gender": "Male"
  }'
```

**What happens:**
1. User account created with `PENDING_ADMIN` status
2. `isApproved` set to `false`
3. `requestedAt` timestamp recorded
4. **Email sent to super admin** with registration details
5. Applicant receives response: "Admin registration request submitted. Please wait for approval from the super admin."

### 2. Super Admin Notification

The super admin receives an email notification with:

```
Subject: New Admin Registration Request - Cinebook

üö® Admin Registration Alert

New Admin Registration Request
Someone has registered as an admin and requires your approval.

Registration Details:
- User ID: 123
- Username: potential_admin
- Email: admin@example.com
- Phone: 1234567890
- Request Time: 2025-07-29T22:30:15

üëÜ CLICK TO APPROVE ADMIN üëÜ
[APPROVE ADMIN] <- This is a clickable button

Or copy this link: http://localhost:8080/api/super-admin/approve/123

Security Notice:
This user will NOT have admin access until you manually approve their request.
```

### 3. Simple One-Click Approval

**Super Simple Process:**
1. Someone registers as admin
2. Super admin gets email with approval link
3. Super admin clicks the link
4. Admin is approved and notified

When super admin clicks the approval link:
- Opens a webpage saying "‚úÖ Admin Approved Successfully!"
- The admin gets promoted to `ROLE_ADMIN`
- **Admin gets email notification**: "You have been registered as an admin"

## üîß Auto-Resend Enhancement

### Enhanced OTP Handling

The system now includes an auto-resend feature for expired approval links:

**After (New Behavior):**
- When super admin clicks approval link but OTP has expired
- System automatically resends the admin approval email to super admin
- Shows success page: "New Approval Email Sent!"
- Super admin receives fresh notification with new approval links

### Technical Implementation

**Enhanced AdminApprovalService:**

```java
public void resendAdminRegistrationNotification(Long userId) {
    Optional<User> userOpt = userRepository.findById(userId);
    
    if (userOpt.isEmpty()) {
        throw new RuntimeException("User not found with ID: " + userId);
    }

    User user = userOpt.get();
    
    if (!"PENDING_ADMIN".equals(user.getRole())) {
        throw new RuntimeException("User is not in pending admin state");
    }

    // Resend the admin registration notification
    emailService.sendAdminRegistrationNotification(
            user.getUsername(),
            user.getEmail(),
            user.getPhone(),
            userId);

    logger.info("Resent admin registration notification for user: {} (ID: {})", user.getUsername(), userId);
}
```

**Enhanced SuperAdminController:**

```java
if (storedOtp == null) {
    // OTP expired - resend admin registration notification
    try {
        adminApprovalService.resendAdminRegistrationNotification(userId);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK)
                .header("Content-Type", "text/html")
                .body(createResendSuccessPage(userId));
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
                .header("Content-Type", "text/html")
                .body(createErrorPage(
                        "OTP expired and unable to resend notification. Please contact support."));
    }
}
```

## üéØ Super Admin Management

  }'
```

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Super Admin Access Requirements
- Must be authenticated (have valid JWT token)
- Token must be for the super admin email: `tri******7@gmail.com`
- Email verification is done in the controller layer

### Regular Admin Access Requirements
- Must have `ROLE_ADMIN` role
- Must have `isApproved = true`
- Pending or rejected admins are automatically blocked

### User Access

| **PENDING_ADMIN** | Admin registration pending approval | No admin access |
| **ROLE_ADMIN** | Approved admin | Full admin access |
| **REJECTED_ADMIN** | Rejected admin application | No admin access |

## üö´ Security Restrictions

### What Pending Admins Cannot Do:

## üîß Database Schema

New fields added to `User` model:
- `isApproved` (Boolean) - Approval status
- `approvedBy` (String) - Who approved the admin
- `requestedAt` (LocalDateTime) - When admin registration was requested
- `approvedAt` (LocalDateTime) - When admin was approved

## üö¶ Error Handling & Recovery

- Provides clear next steps

### Failed Resend
- Shows error page with support contact
- Logs failure for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation

### Edge Cases Handled

- User no longer in pending state
- Email service failures
- Database connectivity issues
