## Overview

The BookingController provides a comprehensive movie ticket booking system with the following key features:

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication with role-based access control
- **Seat Number Selection**: Human-readable seat selection (A1, B2, etc.)
- **Mock Payment Integration**: Realistic payment processing with validation
- **Race Condition Handling**: Thread-safe booking operations
- **Session Management**: Temporary seat locking with automatic cleanup
- **Streamlined Flow**: Two-step booking process for better UX
- **Admin Controls**: Complete administrative booking management

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api/bookings
```

---

## Authentication & Security

### üîê AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED

All booking endpoints require JWT authentication with appropriate roles:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **USER Role**: Can create, view, and cancel own bookings
- **ADMIN Role**: Full access to all bookings and management functions

### Token Extraction
User details are automatically extracted from JWT tokens using `@RequestHeader("Authorization")`:

```java
@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<?> createBooking(@Valid @RequestBody BookingRequest request,
        @RequestHeader("Authorization") String authHeader) {
    String userEmail = extractUserEmailFromToken(authHeader);
    // ...
}
```

    "slotId": 1,
    "paymentMethod": "MOCK_PAYMENT",
    "cardNumber": "4111111111111111",
    "cardHolderName": "John Doe",
    "expiryDate": "12/25",
    "cvv": "123"
  }'
```

#### Test Case 3: Payment Failure
```bash
# Use invalid card details to trigger payment failure
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/bookings \
